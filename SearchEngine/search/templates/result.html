The results of a search for the term "lunar eclipse" in a web-based image search engine
A 'web search engine' is a software system that is designed to search for information on 
the World Wide Web. The search results are generally presented in a line of results often referred 
to as search engine results pages (SERPs). The information may be a mix of web pages, images, and other types of files. 
Some search engines also mine data available in databases or open directories. Unlike web directories,
which are maintained only by human editors, search engines also maintain real-time information by running an
algorithm on a web crawler.

The repository of web pages is referred to as the 'Index', and it is this data store which is organized and used to provide the search results you see on the search engine. Indexing is the process of organizing the masses of data and pages so they can be searched quickly for relevant results to your search query.
